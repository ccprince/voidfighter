# voidfighter

Squadron builder for Voidfighter, by Casey Garske, and published by Osprey Games

There's enough functionality here to stat up a squadron. You'll need a copy of the rule
book, available from [Osprey Games](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/voidfighter-9781472866448/),
to actually understand what you're doing, and to be able to use the squadron.

The goal here is to come up with a legal squadron, and print out usable stat
sheets. This means that the Squadron Traits which add bonuses to ships' stats are
implemented. The rest of the traits, both squadron and leader, are included even
though they don't do anything; they'll still be included on the sheets.

# Roadmap

Features current in-plan, though in no particular order:

- Print-friendly layout in the browser
- Export to PDF
- Export to 3x5 cards, in PDF format (What can I say? I like having cards.)
